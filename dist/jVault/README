Use jVault.bat or jVault.sh to start program. Optional initial file on command line.
jVault comes with sample encrypted password file called sample.txt. Password is: sample. 

v1.0 April 1, 2010 (no, really)
v1.0.1 Sept 12, 2010 - Added support for initial file on command line. 
v1.0.2 Nov 11, 2010 - Lest we forget. 
 Fixed 8k limit problem problem. Removed from Known Issues. 
 Fixed saving new file. Prompted for password if modified and saved a second time.   

TODO: 
 - Open html help file from File->Help link.
 - Look at reading encrypted file by byte stream. Needs cleaning up. 
 - Incorporate new JASYPT 1.7 libraries. There should be a 'lite' jar that would be more appropriate
