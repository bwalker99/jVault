Use jVault.bat or jVault.sh to start program. Optional initial file on command line.
jVault comes with sample encrypted password file called sample.txt. Password is: sample. 

v1.0 April 1, 2010 (no, really)
v1.0.1 Sept 12, 2010 - Added support for initial file on command line. 

TODO: 
 - Open html help file from File->Help link. 

Known Issues: 
 - There Seems to be about an 8k limit on the encrypted file. 
   Maybe be some limitation in the jasypt libraries. Need to investigate.
